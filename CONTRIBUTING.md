## Guidelines

- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages.
- Write clear, concise PR descriptions explaining the _what_ and _why_ of your changes.
- Ensure that your code passes existing lint rules (`npm run lint`).
- Add or update tests for new functionality where appropriate.
- Keep PRs focused on a single concern to make review easier.

## Branching Strategy

- `main` should always be deployable and production-ready.
- Create feature branches off of `main` using the `feature/` prefix.
- Use `fix/` prefix for small bug fixes and `chore/` for non-functional tasks.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or want to request a feature, please open an [issue](https://github.com/your-org/blr-events/issues) providing:

- A clear and descriptive title.
- Detailed steps to reproduce (for bugs).
- Expected and actual behavior.
- Screenshots or logs, if relevant.

## Pull Request Review

- Assign at least one reviewer.
- Reviewers may request changes or approve the PR.
- Once approved, maintainers will merge and squash commits into `main`.

## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). By participating, you agree to abide by its terms.
